# HTB Nibbles

## Objective

The purpose of this Lab is to achieve highest privilege escalation possible.
### Skills Learned

- Usage of NMap to perform basic network enumeration.  The target machine associated with this lab provides us with the IP address making this a grey-box PenTest.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
