# HTB Nibbles

## Objective

The purpose of this Lab is to achieve highest privilege escalation possible.
### Skills Learned

- Usage of NMap to perform basic network enumeration.  The target machine associated with this lab provides us with the IP address making this a grey-box PenTest.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of Linux and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem-solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used

- NMap
- GoBuster: used mainly for brute-forcing files
- Metasploit

- The use of NMap commmand line, able to see any open ports on target machine
- Quick google search of the open port gave more insight to potential vulnerabilties
